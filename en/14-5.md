# Wrap up

<!-- YOUTUBE: Dxfd0O29omA -->

You have another game under your belt, and I hope your brain is already starting to bubble up ideas for things you can do to improve it. Plus, you learned more skills, not least `SKCropNode`, `SKTexture`, GCD's `asyncAfter()`, plus lots of new `SKAction` types, so it's all time well spent.

Try experimenting with the difficulty and see what you come up with – is it easier or harder if the penguin show/hide animation happens at random speeds?


## Review what you learned

Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It’s my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I’ve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.

## Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
2. When showing “Game Over” add an `SKLabelNode` showing their final score.
3. Use `SKEmitterNode` to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole.
