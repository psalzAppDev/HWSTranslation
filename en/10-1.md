# Setting up

<!-- YOUTUBE: Rsl8rYjFGLM -->

This is a fun, simple and useful project that will let you create an app to help store names of people you've met. If you're a frequent traveller, or perhaps just bad at putting names to faces, this project will be perfect for you.

And yes, you'll be learning lots along the way: this time you'll meet `UICollectionViewController`, `UIImagePickerController`, `Data`, and `UUID`. Plus you'll get to do more with your old pals `CALayer`, `UIAlertController`, and closures. But above all, you're going to learn how to make a new data type from scratch for the first time.

Create a new Single View App project in Xcode, call it Project10, then save it somewhere. This should be second nature to you by now â€“ you're becoming a veteran!
