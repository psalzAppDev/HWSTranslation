# Wrap up

This wasn't a complicated project, but I hope it was a satisfying one. The addition of new techniques like `SKAudioNode` and parallax scrolling should have made it more interesting even for more experienced coders, and it was fun adding the extra bit of polish at the end to make the whole game feel more complete.

If you want to take this project further, you could start by having different kinds of obstacles – the repeating rocks do get a bit tiresome after a while! You could also make the game difficulty ramp up ever so slowly, either by decreasing the gap between the rocks or by increasing the world gravity.

To make the game much more challenging, how about introducing a secondary scoring mechanism: perhaps the player could get extra points if they fly through hoops in between the rocks? If you fancy a bigger challenge, how about making it a universal game, i.e. support both iPad and iPhone.
