# Wrap up

<!-- YOUTUBE: njZ8SkzlDxU -->

This project is done, and it's been a long one, but I hope you look at the results and think it was all worth it. Plus, you've once again learned a lot: SpriteKit, physics, blend modes, radians and `CGFloat`.

You’ve got the firm foundations of a real game here, but there's lots more you can do to make it even better.


## Review what you learned

Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It’s my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I’ve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.

## Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
2. Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
3. Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
