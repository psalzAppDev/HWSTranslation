# Setting up

<!-- YOUTUBE: u7ovZkewpHc -->

In this technique project we're going to return to project 7 to solve a critical problem using one of the most important Apple frameworks available: Grand Central Dispatch, or GCD. I already mentioned the problem to you, but here's a recap from project 7:

*By downloading data from the internet in `viewDidLoad()` our app will lock up until all the data has been transferred. There are solutions to this, but to avoid complexity they won't be covered until project 9.*

We're going to solve this problem by using GCD, which will allow us to fetch the data without locking up the user interface. But be warned: even though GCD might seem easy at first, it opens up a new raft of problems, so be careful!

If you want to keep your previous work for reference, take a copy of project 7 now and call it project 9. Otherwise, just modify it in place.
